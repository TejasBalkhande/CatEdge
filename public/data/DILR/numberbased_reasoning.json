    "explanation": "J receives candies from C-F. Let total candies given to children by C-F be x. Then J (one child) gets x/3? Actually, C-F has 3 children (I,J,K), so each gets x/3. But J=4 → x=12. Candies to children: C-F gives 12 (4 each to I,J,K). E-H gives 6 (3 each to M,N). D-G gives 6 to L (only child). Thus K=4, L=6, N=3 → Ratio 4:6:3 = 2:6:3 after simplifying? Wait: 4:6:3 is already simplified? But options show 2:6:3 which is equivalent to 4:12:6? Correction: K=4 (from C-F), L=6 (from D-G), N=3 (from E-H). Ratio K:L:N=4:6:3 which matches 2:6:3 when divided by 2? 4/2=2, 6/2=3? No, 2:6:3=2/2:6/2:3/2=1:3:1.5. Actually, 4:6:3 is not equal to 2:6:3. Clarification: The ratio K:L:N=4:6:3. Option c is 2:6:3 which is 2/2:6/2:3/2? Mistake in reasoning. Correct: K gets x/3=4, L gets y (from D-G), N gets z (from E-H). Standard distribution: For couple with children, total to children is multiple of number of children. But here different couples have different children. From answer: Ratio 2:6:3 means K=2, L=6, N=3. But J=4 and J is sibling of K → same parents C-F, so K should also get 4. Contradiction. Recheck explanation: 'Candies received by K = x/3, L = x, N = x/2' in original key. Let x be total given to children by each couple (same for all). Then for C-F (3 children): each gets x/3. For D-G (1 child): gets x. For E-H (2 children): each gets x/2. Thus K=x/3, L=x, N=x/2. Ratio = (x/3):x:(x/2) = 2:6:3 (multiply by 6). With J=x/3=4 → x=12 → K=4, L=12, N=6 → Ratio 4:12:6=2:6:3.",

    "answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Physics+Chemistry+Biology=16. Biology max=5 (since no middle/stalwart, and constraints). Thus Physics+Chemistry ≥16-5=11. But Biology can be less (min 4), so Physics+Chemistry could be 12. However, option I says ≤12 – not always true (could be 13). Option II: ≥12? Minimum possible: if Biology=5, then Physics+Chemistry=11<12? But 11<12, so not ≥12 always. Recheck: Base without extra: Physics=4, Chemistry=4, Biology=4? Total 12. Plus 3 extra: if all go to Physics/Chemistry, max=4+4+3=11? No: base distribution: Physics=2+1+0+1+1=5? Young: Phys=2, Chem=1, Bio=1, Math=1. Middle: Phys=1, Chem=1, Bio=0, Math=2 → total Phys=5, Chem=4, Bio=3? Then with 3 extra (1 middle, 2 retired), if assigned to Bio, Bio=3+3=6? But Bio cannot have middle/retired? Bio can have retired. Bio: Young=1, Senior=1, Retired=1 → total 3. With 2 extra retired, can assign to Bio → Bio=5. Then Phys+Chem=16-5=11. If assign extras to Phys/Chem, Phys+Chem=16-3=13. Thus range 11-13. So II is not always true (11<12), I not always true (13>12). But answer grid says 21:b (Only II). Contradiction. Clarification: 'Only II' is marked, but explanation says ≥12? Actually, minimum is 11, so II is false. Error in reasoning. Original answer: \"It is more than or equal to 12\" → true because minimum is 12? How? Base: Physics+Chemistry+Biology=16. Biology maximum possible=5 (since no middle/stalwart, and retired can be 2 max? Actually, Bio: young,senior,retired only, max 2+2+2=6? But constraints: each cell max 2. Young Bio=1, Senior Bio=1, Retired Bio=1 initially, can add 2 retired → total Bio=1+1+3=5? Then Phys+Chem=11. But 11<12. However, the answer is Only II. Possible mistake. Alternative: Total lecturers=25. Math=9. So PCB=16. Bio min=3 (young+senior+retired). Thus Phys+Chem ≤16-3=13. Bio max=1(young)+1(senior)+3(retired)=5 → Phys+Chem≥11. So 11≤P+C≤13. Thus not always ≥12. But answer is Only II. Recheck the grid: Q21 answer is 2 (which is b: Only II). Explanation in key: \"Maximum only one more lecturer can be in Biology team. So, total number of Physics and Chemistry lecturers put together must be more than or equals to 12.\" How? If we assign both extra retired to Bio, Bio=1(young)+1(senior)+3(retired)=5. Then P+C=11<12. If we assign only one to Bio, Bio=4, P+C=12. If none, Bio=3, P+C=13. So it can be 11,12,13. Thus not always ≥12. But the key says must be ≥12. Contradiction. Perhaps I miscount. Base distribution before extras: \nYoung: Phys=2, Chem=1, Bio=1, Math=1 → total young=5\nMiddle: Phys=1, Chem=1, Bio=0, Math=2 → total middle=4? But should be 5. Mistake: initial table has Middle: total 4, but should be 5. Correction: initial setup has Young=5, Middle=5, etc. Base distribution for Middle: Phys=1, Chem=1, Math=2, Bio=0 → total=4, but Middle should be 5 → so one more middle to assign. Similarly retired base=5, should be 7 → two more retired. So extras: 1 middle, 2 retired. Now Bio: can have middle? No (III: no Bio middle). So Bio can only get retired extras. Bio base: young=1, senior=1, retired=1. Can add up to 2 retired → Bio max=1+1+3=5. Then P+C=16-5=11. If add only 1 retired to Bio, Bio=4, P+C=12. If no retired to Bio, Bio=3, P+C=13. Thus P+C=11,12, or 13. So not always ≥12. But the answer key says Only II. Perhaps the question is about certainty. The question is \"what can be said\", implying what is always true. Since P+C can be 11,12,13, neither I nor II is always true. But the answer is Only II. Discrepancy. Perhaps in the context, 'must be at least 12' is not always true. But grid says 21:2 → Only II.

Recheck: \"If Kandy is the only retired Chemistry lecturer, then Physics, Maths and Biology team will contain 2 retired lecturers each.\" How? Base: Phys=1, Chem=1, Math=2, Bio=1 retired. Total=5. Retired total=7, so two more. Since Chem can have only one, the two must be assigned to Phys, Math, or Bio. But each can take one more (max two per discipline per age group). So possibilities: both to Bio → Bio=3 retired? But max two per cell. Each discipline can have up to two retired. Base: Phys=1, Math=2, Bio=1 → so Phys can take one more, Bio can take one more, Math cannot take more (already two). Thus the two extra must go: one to Phys and one to Bio.

Total number of lecturers in Physics, Chemistry and Biology put together is the square of an integer.\nIII. There is no Biology lecturer who is middle aged or stalwart and there is no Physics lecturer who is a senior. Every other discipline is represented by at least one lecturer from each age group.\nIV. Rocky and Platy are Young Physics lecturers.\n\nNow the following questions pertain to those selected lecturers.",

    "question": "Which of the combinations is NOT possible?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Two retired Physics lecturers and two retired Chemistry lecturers were selected for the conclave.",
      "b": "One retired Physics lecturer and two retired Chemistry lecturers were selected for the conclave.",
      "c": "One retired Physics lecturer and one retired Chemistry lecturer were selected for the conclave.",
      "d": "Two retired Physics lecturers and one retired Chemistry lecturer were selected for the conclave."
    },
    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Retired total=7. Base: Phys=1, Chem=1, Math=2, Bio=1 → total=5. Two extra retired to assign. Option c: one retired Phys and one retired Chem → total retired Phys=2, Chem=2. But base already has Phys=1, Chem=1 → adding one to each makes Phys=2, Chem=2. Total retired=5 (base) +2=7. However, this is possible. But the answer is c. Why not possible? Key says it's not possible. Perhaps because with Phys=2 and Chem=2, but we have two extras, and it's allowed. But the grid says c. Recheck constraints: \"not more than two lecturers of a particular age group and particular discipline\". So Phys retired=2 allowed, Chem=2 allowed. But why not possible? Original answer: \"(3) One retired Physics lecturer and one retired Chemistry lecturer were selected for the conclave.\" is not possible. But base already has one each, so total would be two each if we add one more. But the combination says \"one retired Phys and one retired Chem\" – this might mean total one each, but base already has one, so if we add, it becomes two. The option says \"were selected\" implying total. So option c means total one Phys retired and one Chem retired. But base already has at least one each, so minimum one each, and with extras, could be more. To have exactly one each, we cannot add extra to them, but must add to others. But base has one each, so to keep one, we don't add extra to them. But then we have to assign the two extras to Math or Bio. Math base=2 (max), Bio base=1 (can take one more). So assign one to Bio and one to Math? But Math already has two, cannot take more. Bio can take one. So only one extra can be placed. Contradiction. Thus impossible to have exactly one retired Phys and one retired Chem because base already has one each, and we cannot reduce, and if we don't add to them, we can only place one extra (to Bio), leaving one extra unplaced, which violates total retired=7. Thus option c is impossible.",
