Correction: At least two = (X∩Y only + Y∩Z only + Z∩X only + XYZ) = (2.0 + 1.0 + 0.5 + 0.5) = 4.0? Wait: From Venn: 2.5 (X∩Y) includes XYZ, so only two: (2.5-0.5)=2, (1.5-0.5)=1, (1.0-0.5)=0.5, plus all three 0.5 → total 4.0. Population=140 lakhs. Percentage= (4/140)×100≈2.86%. But option c is 3.9. Recalculation: At least two regions: 2.5 (XY) + 1.5 (YZ) + 1.0 (ZX) - 2×0.5 (XYZ) = 5 - 1 = 4.0? Alternatively, from diagram: regions with at least two: 2.5+1.5+1.0 - 3×0.5 + 0.5? Correct: sum of two-only and three: 2.0 (XY only) +1.0 (YZ only) +0.5 (ZX only) +0.5 (XYZ) = 4.0. 4/140≈2.86% not matching. Answer key says 3.9. Perhaps total at least two is 5.5? (2.5+1.5+1.0=5.0, but double-counted intersections. Minus the triple counted XYZ? Standard: n(A∪B∪C) = single - double + triple. But at least two = double - 3triple + triple = double - 2triple. double= XY+XZ+YZ=2.5+1.0+1.5=5.0. triple=0.5. At least two=5.0 - 2×0.5=4.0. 4/140≈2.86%. But answer key says 3.9. Discrepancy.
