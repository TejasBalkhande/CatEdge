Economists and technologists believe that a new kind of capitalism is being created - different from industrial capitalism as was merchant capitalism.\n3. In 1962, Kenneth Arrow, the guru of mainstream economics, said that in a free market economy the purpose of inventing things is to create intellectual property rights.\n4. There is, alongside the world of monopolised information and surveillance, a different dynamic growing up: information as a social good, incapable of being owned or exploited or priced.\n5. Yet information is abundant. Information goods are freely replicable. Once a thing is made, it can be copied and pasted infinitely.",

    "explanation": "Correct Answer: 2. Explanation: We notice that Statement (3) serves as an introduction by touching upon the topic of intellectual property rights. Statement (1) continues along this line and mentions how 'monopolizing and protecting data' can be observed in certain business models. Thus, the discussion revolves around data/information and its place in the market system. Statement (5) mentions that despite the monopolization, 'information is abundant'. And this brings us to the description in Statement (4) which portrays information differently - as a social good. Hence, although a bit discontiguous, 3-1-5-4 seems to talk about the same subject while Statement (2) (on 'Merchant Capitalism') diverges from it.",

One thing we often do with narratives of sexual assault is sort their respective parties into different temporalities: it seems we are interested in perpetrators’ futures and victims’ pasts.\n3. One result is that we don’t have much of a vocabulary for what happens in a victim’s life after the painful past has been excavated, even when our shared language gestures toward the future, as the term 'survivor' does.\n4. Even the most charitable questions asked about the victims seem to focus on the past, in pursuit of understanding or of corroboration of painful details.\n5. As more and more stories of sexual assault have been made public in the last two years, the genre of their telling has exploded --- crimes have a tendency to become not just stories but genres.",

Statement (3) delineates on the outcome of the latter: the focus on a victim’s past' and Statement (1) further adds to this point.

He highlights the kind of claims that these journals state: presence in 'influential databases', quality 'editorial boards' and a 'rigorous peer-review structure' (Statement 4). On the surface, 'they are exactly like any reputed journal' (Statement 3). However, the ground reality is starkly different: paying money allows you to publish anything in such predatory journal (Statement 2). Hence, arrangement 1432 forms a coherent paragraph with predatory journals as the centre of attention. Statement 5 deviates from this subject.

    "passage": "1. For feminists, the question of how we read is inextricably linked with the question of what we read.\n2. Elaine Showalter’s critique of the literary curriculum is exemplary of this work.\n3. Androcentric literature structures the reading experience differently depending on the gender of the reader.\n4. The documentation of this realization was one of the earliest tasks undertaken by feminist critics.\n5. More specifically, the feminist inquiry into the activity of reading begins with the realization that the literary canon is androcentric, and that this has a profoundly damaging effect on women readers.",

    "passage": "1. Talk was the most common way for enslaved men and women to subvert the rules of their bondage, to gain more agency than they were supposed to have.\n2. Even in conditions of extreme violence and unfreedom, their words remained ubiquitous, ephemeral, irrepressible, and potentially transgressive.\n3. Slaves came from societies in which oaths, orations, and invocations carried great potency, both between people and as a connection to the all-powerful spirit world.\n4. Freedom of speech and the power to silence may have been preeminent markers of white liberty in Colonies, but at the same time, slavery depended on dialogue: slaves could never be completely muted.\n5. Slave-owners obsessed over slave talk, though they could never control it, yet feared its power to bind and inspire—for, as everyone knew, oaths, whispers, and secret conversations bred conspiracy and revolt.",

Hate speech detection is part of the on-going effort against oppressive and abusive language on social media.\n3. The current automatic detection models miss out on something vital: context.\n4. It uses complex algorithms to flag racist or violent speech faster and better than human beings alone.\n5. For instance, algorithms struggle to determine if group identifiers like 'gay' or 'black' are used in offensive or prejudiced ways because they’re trained on imbalanced datasets with unusually high rates of hate speech.",

    "passage": "1. The logic of displaying one’s inner qualities through outward appearance was based on a distinction between being a woman and being feminine.\n2. 'Appearance' became a signifier of conduct - to look was to be and conformity to the feminine ideal was measured by how well women could use the tools of the fashion and beauty industries.\n3. The makeover-centric media sets out subtly and not-so-subtly, 'good' and 'bad' ways to be a woman, layering these over inequalities of race and class.\n4. The denigration of working-class women and women of colour often centres on their perceived failure to embody feminine beauty.\n5. 'Woman' was considered a biological category, but femininity was a 'process' by which women became specific kinds of women.",
