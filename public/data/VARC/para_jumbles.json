Statement 2 contains the question—can art also make us behave more empathically? Statement 4 answers that question by asking another question - If art connects us with the mind of the creator, is not that a form of empathy? So, these statements complement each other. Statement 3 contains the phrase ‘it means...’, and statement 1 continues with ‘it also means...’, so, it is easy to connect them. Hence, the proper sequence is 2431.",

Statement 2 continues elaborating on the term origami and how it amuses the scientists by scratching their fundamental itch of creating something out of nothing. Statement 3 continues to explain how the art of making origami is perceived today (by innovative builders). Statement 3 talks of useful structures, and statement 4 stresses that nothing could be a more useful structure than a shelter. (Indicating the use of origami in structure science.)

Statement 1 contains the phrase ‘she told KDKA...’, which means we need to find the antecedent of this pronoun ‘she’. It’s easy to locate that ‘she’ in statement 3 (Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm). So, 31 is a pair. Statement 3 begins with 'Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm has echoed these ideas' which means we need to find ideas which she has echoed. Statement 2 contains those ideas. So, the sequence that can be reached is: 231. Statement 1 contains another idea that has been picked up under pressure (policy to phase out fossil fuels directly) which sets the stage for a discussion. Hence, it should be the opening statement.
