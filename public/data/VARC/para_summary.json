    "question": "Choose the best one. The Shveta-chattra or the ‘White Umbrella’ was a symbol of sovereign po litical authority placed over the mon arch’s head at the time of the coronation. The ruler so inaugurated was regarded not as a temporal autocrat but as the in strument of the protective and shelter ing firmament of supreme law. The white umbrella symbol is of great antiquity and its varied use illustrates the ultimate common basis of the non-theocratic na ture of states in the Indian tradition. As such, the umbrella is found, although not necessarily a white one, over the head of Lord Ram, the Mohammedan sultans, and Chhatrapati Shivaji. Which one of the following best summarises the above passage?",
    "options": {
      "a": "The placing of an umbrella over the ruler’s head was a common practice in the Indian subcontinent.",
      "b": "The white umbrella represented the instrument of the firmament of the supreme law and the non-theocratic nature of Indian states.",
      "c": "The umbrella, not necessarily a white one, was a symbol of sovereign polit ical authority.",
      "d": "The varied use of the umbrella sym bolised the common basis of the non-theocratic nature of states in the Indian tradition."
    },
    "answer": "d",
    "explanation": "Option A is very vague in its implica tion and misses the significance of the Shveta-chattra tradition explained in the given paragraph. Option B is a wordplay that is really hard to spot. It states that the white umbrella represented the in strument, but the paragraph has as cribed the quality of being an instrument of the supreme law to the ruler who was coronated. Option C misses out on the significance of the white umbrella tradi tion and is merely a reiteration of the first statement of the paragraph. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.",

The fear of not getting enough to get by tomor row is made worse by the fear of living an alienated life without family, made worse by the greatest fear of all, no med ical care. Then there are certain givens that do not need reiterating for their col our fades if left for long in the sun. It does not move anybody, any longer, to say that the poverty line is here, no here, no here, or that the minimum calorie in take should be 2,100 or 2,300 or 1,800. These numbers are just numbers on a continual scale, but there are other in dicators, more compelling than those on a sliding one.

The intention here, as should be abundantly clear, is to masquerade as small to take advantage of the above-mentioned provisions. This is what prompts many entrepreneurs in India to game the system. In other words, they make themselves look ‘small’ to get cheaper inputs, and access to state-pi loted markets, over and above, winning an indulgent wink and nod from inspec tors. While all that may seem innocuous enough in the short run, Ramaswamy has convincingly demonstrated that small ness is strongly correlated with ineffi ciency and low productivity.",

Yet the realisation that a healthy whole is larger than its parts never stopped informing cultures. It embodies the pillars of Christianity as much as the Islamic Golden Age, the Enlightenment, or the New Deal.

During the 1960s, Martin Luther King, Jr gave voice to the broader idea when he said that no one is free un til we are all free. On Earth Day 1970, U.S. senator Edmund Muskie proclaimed that the only society to survive is one that ‘will not tolerate slums for some and de cent houses for others, … clean air for some and filth for others.’.

They played with the ambiguity of authenticity at a time when most Internet users were already scep tical of online content. The ‘culture jam ming’ tactic used by the Yes Men took its cue from Guy Debord and the so-called situationists of the 1960s, who advanced social and political critique. In the 1980s and 1990s, culture jamming unified ac tivists around a common cause and set of tactics, such as making minor edits to an advertisement to drastically change its meaning.

Fundamental shifts in American views of the race were already underway be fore the COVID-19 disparities became clear and before the latest examples of police violence surfaced, but it is easy for one to see these shifts as the direct result of the horrifying events that have unfolded in 2020: a pandemic that has had a disproportionate effect on peo ple of colour; the video of George Floyd dying beneath the knee of an impassive Minneapolis police officer; the ghastly killing of Breonna Taylor, shot to death in her own home. What we are witnessing right now is the culmination of a longer process—a process that tracks closely with the political career of Donald Trump. The percentage of Americans who told Monmouth pollsters that racial and eth nic discrimination is a big problem made a greater leap from January 2015 (51 per cent) to July 2016 (68 percent) than from July 2016 to June 2020 (76 percent).",

Whereas Aristotle saw all of existence, including human beings, as things we could classify and analyse to increase our understanding of the world, in Being and Time (1927) Heidegger argued that, be fore we start classifying Being, we should f irst ask the question: ‘Who or what is doing all this questioning’? Heidegger pointed out that we who are asking ques tions about Being are qualitatively differ ent to the rest of existence: the rocks, oceans, trees, birds, and insects that we are asking about. He invented a special word for this Being that asks, looks, and cares. He called it Dasein, which loosely translates as ‘being there’. He coined the term Dasein because he believed that we had become immune to words such as ‘person’, ‘human’, and ‘human being’, los ing our sense of wonder about our own consciousness. conflict that persisted between Aristotle and Heidegger’s ideologies with respect to the concept of Being.",

    "question": "Choose the best one. From the previous discussion, one can see the emergence of two contradicting narratives. On 2 October 2019, all the vil lages in the 36 states and union territo ries of India were declared ODF. The India map on the SBM (Grameen) website, which recorded progress towards the 100% ODF goal, turned entirely green, in dicating that the policy’s ambitious goal had been achieved. However, a survey re leased by the National Statistical Office (NSO) in November 2019 claimed that about 28.7% of rural households across India still lacked access to any form of latrines. Moreover, it stated that 3.5% of those who have access to latrines do not use it. The SBM data and the NSO data contradict each other; this may be be cause the SBM data does not account for behavioural changes, which are extreme ly hard to achieve. This raises the follow ing questions: Has the scheme also set in motion behavioural changes regarding sanitation practices and beliefs and myths around toilet usage in proportion to the provision of individual household latrines? Is this even remotely possible?",

During the first half of the 20th cen tury, the critical perception of Dickens kept changing, as exemplified by a pair of magnificent essays that appeared in 1940: one by George Orwell and one by Edmund Wilson.

Orwell, although naturally more concerned with Dickens’s political and social stances—Dickens, af ter all, was famous for his savage attacks on institutions like Parliament—was also responsive to the genius of the writing, while Wilson focused more on the emo tional, or psychic, the duality of Dickens’s vision of life. Both critics, however, writ ing 70 years after his death, were not merely proclaiming but assuming his greatness. “It is the purpose of this es say”, Wilson wrote, “to show that we may f ind in Dickens’s work today a complexity and a depth … an intellectual and artistic interest which makes Dickens loom very large in the whole perspective of the lit erature of the West”. Here is a judgment that would have bewildered the gran dees of the not-so-distant Bloomsbury generation, authorities like E. M.

That the earth is a representative of the whole universe and is set in dynamic mo tion is realised both in the Eastern and Western thinking, and is not a matter for deep deliberation. Both the occident and the orient have influenced each other in arriving at the idea. But advancement in modern earth science has something more to contribute in giving us details of the earth which made its frame amenable for life to enter. The primary geochemi cal differentiation of the earth dividing it into an external shell of crust, the middle shell of the mantle, and the inner shell of the core is something salutary. This has not happened in any other member of the solar family or if it had happened it is not complete in all respect to have produced a geomagnetic field as has been done by the earth. As a result of the generation of a geomagnetic field by the virtue of which the surface of the earth is having solar light filtered of all harmful types of rays like x-rays, a protective field for life to manifest on the earth was created.

He hit and killed the child. Luck can do more than just happen to us; it can af fect what we do. Or, to put it another way: what we do is not fully in our con trol.

After controlling for both genetic and cultural transmission of family human capital (as measured by various IQ test scores, years of educa tion, and income), we find that ances tral jinshi density (measured separate ly along the patrilineal and matrilineal lines) has a significantly positive effect on the offspring’s attitude toward the importance of education in determining social status.

In cases in which privatiz ing certain responsibilities would lead to massive gains in terms of, say, distribu tive justice that could not be achieved otherwise, these gains may well override considerations of legitimacy and thus also the case for constitutional limits.
