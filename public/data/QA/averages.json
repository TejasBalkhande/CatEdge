    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Let month2=x. Month3=1.2x. Month4=1.2x × (1+61/7700)=1.2x×(7761/7700)=1.2x×1.008=1.2096x. Given: 1.2096x - x = 1130 → 0.2096x=1130 → x≈5394. Month3=1.2×5394≈6473. Month4≈1.2096×5394≈6524. Total=4500+5394+6473+6524=22891. Average=22891/4=5722.75? Correction: 61/77% = 61/7700. Month4 = 1.2x × (1 + 61/7700) = 1.2x × 7761/7700. 7761/7700≈1.007922. Thus 1.2×1.007922x≈1.2095064x. Difference: 0.2095064x=1130 → x=1130/0.2095064≈5394. Then month3=1.2×5394=6472.8, month4=1.2095064×5394≈6524. Total: 4500+5394+6472.8+6524=22890.8. Average=5722.7? But not matching options. Recheck with fractions: Month4 = 1.2x × (1 + 61/7700) = (6/5)x × (7761/7700) = (6/5)×(7761/7700)x = (46566/38500)x. Difference = [46566/38500 - 1]x = (8066/38500)x = 1130. Thus x=1130×38500/8066. Calculate: 1130×38500=435050000, divide by 8066≈53940. Then month2=53940? Too big. Error: 8066/38500 = 1130/x → x=1130×38500/8066. Compute: 38500/8066≈4.772, 1130×4.772≈5394. Same as before. Then total: M1=4500, M2=5394, M3=1.2×5394=6472.8, M4=1.2095064×5394≈6524. Sum=4500+5394=9894; +6472.8=16366.8; +6524=22890.8. Average=22890.8/4=5722.7. But options are ~447x. Correction in problem: Difference is between 4th and 2nd month: Month4 - month2=1130. But our calculation gives 6524-5394=1130. Total=4500+5394+6473+6524=22891. Average=22891/4=5722.75 not in options. Note: 61/77% is 61/7700, but 61/77 % might be misinterpreted. Alternative: 61/77 % = (61/77)/100 = 61/(77×100). But solution says: Month4 = 1.2x × (1 + 61/7700) = 1.2x × 7761/7700. Then 7761/7700 = 7761÷77 / 7700÷77 = 100.792207/100? Better: 7761/7700 = 1 + 61/7700. Then as before. In solution key: Month4=99.6x/77? 1.2x * (1+61/7700)=1.2x*(7761/7700)= (1.2*7761/7700)x = (9313.2/7700)x≈1.209506x same. Perhaps use: 1.2x * 7761/7700 = (12/10)x * 7761/7700 = (12*7761)x/(10*7700) = 93132x/77000 = 23283x/19250. Then difference = (23283x/19250) - x = (4033x/19250)=1130 → x=1130*19250/4033. Calculate: 19250/4033≈4.773, 1130*4.773≈5393.49. Then month3=1.2*5393.49=6472.188, month4=1.2*5393.49*7761/7700= let's compute 5393.49*7761/7700*1.2. First 5393.49/7700≈0.70045, *7761≈5437.5, *1.2=6525. Then total: 4500+5393.49+6472.188+6525=22890.678, average=5722.67. Still not matching. According to given solution: x=3850, month2=3850, month3=4620, month4=4980, total=4500+3850+4620+4980=17950, average=4487.5. How? Equation: (99.6x/77) - x =1130. 99.6x/77 - 77x/77 = 22.6x/77=1130 → x=1130*77/22.6. 22.6=113/5? 1130*77/22.6 = 1130*770/226 = 1130*385/113 = 10*385=3850. Thus month2=3850, month3=1.2*3850=4620, month4= (99.6*3850)/77. 99.6/77=1.2935, *3850≈4980. Total=4500+3850+4620+4980=17950, average=17950/4=4487.5.",
